# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering techniques to an eCommerce dataset to segment customers and provide actionable marketing insights.

## Dataset

- [Kaggle eCommerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)
- Contains transactions from an online retailer between December 2010 and December 2011.

## Project Structure

- `Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations.

## Key Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and type conversions.
2. **RFM Calculation**: Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
3. **RFM Segmentation**: Assign scores and combine into a unified RFM score.
4. **Clustering**: Segment customers using K-Means and other clustering algorithms.
5. **Segment Profiling**: Analyze and describe each customer segment.
6. **Marketing Recommendations**: Actionable strategies for each segment.
7. **Visualization**: Graphs and plots for insights.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory as `data.csv`.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
